The easiest way to use Authkestra is via the facade crate with feature flags, 
allowing you to manage your authentication stack from a single dependency.

## Using the Facade Crate

Add `authkestra` to your `Cargo.toml` with the features you need:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
# Use the facade with the features you need
authkestra = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["axum", "github"] }

# Async runtime
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

# For environment variables
dotenvy = "0.15"
```

<Callout type="info" title="Feature Flags">
  Authkestra uses Cargo features to enable only what you need. This keeps compile times 
  fast and binary sizes small.
</Callout>

## Available Features

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `axum` | Axum framework integration with extractors and route helpers |
| `actix` | Actix-web framework integration |
| `github` | GitHub OAuth provider |
| `google` | Google OAuth provider |
| `discord` | Discord OAuth provider |
| `oidc` | OpenID Connect support with discovery and validation |
| `session-redis` | Redis session store |
| `session-sql` | SQL session store (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite) |

You can combine multiple features:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
authkestra = { version = "0.1.0", features = [
    "axum",
    "github",
    "google",
    "discord",
    "oidc",
    "session-sql"
] }
```

## Using Individual Crates

For advanced users, individual crates can be used independently:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
authkestra-core = "0.1"
authkestra-flow = "0.1"
authkestra-axum = "0.1"
authkestra-providers-github = "0.1"
authkestra-session = { version = "0.1", features = ["sql"] }
```

<Callout type="tip" title="When to use individual crates">
  Use individual crates when you need fine-grained control over versions, or when 
  implementing custom providers or session stores that don't need the full stack.
</Callout>

## Runtime Requirements

Authkestra is async-first and requires a Tokio runtime:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

# Or minimal features for smaller binaries:
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Environment Variables">
  Most examples use `dotenvy` to load environment variables from 
  a `.env` file. Make sure to add it to your dependencies if you're 
  following along with the examples.
